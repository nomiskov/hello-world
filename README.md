# hello-world
going through hello world guide
this guide seems pretty nice so far
- creating branches for edits...that is a good idea.
- I like that we can have a discussion about the changes
- I also like that you can pull in any changes from the master branch while working on a specific issue isolated in it's own branch, sweet!
- 
What's next?

Commits? Oh yeah. This is where we commit our changes to this file
